***************************EXCEPTION HANDLING************************************

what do you mean by throwing an exception?
-> when an error occurs within a java method, the method creates an exception object and hands it off to the runtime system.
   This process is known as throwing an exception.
   The exception object contains information about the exception, including its type and state of program when the error occurred.

what do you mean by catching an exception?
-> to catch an exception is to take appropriate action to deal with the exception.

***all exceptions are derived from the class java.lang.Throwable.class. Throwable class has 2 subclasses:Exception and Error

Exceptions are of 2 types:

CHECKED EXCEPTIONS : All classes that inherit from Exception class except the RuntimeException are called checked exceptions. 
		     The compiler checks each method call and method declaration to determine whether the method throws checked exceptions.
		     If so, compiler ensures that the checked exception is caught or is declared in a throws clause.	
		    they are checked by the compiler at the time of compilation.
			considered non-fatal
1. ClassNotFoundException 
2. CloneNotSupportedException
3. IllegalAccessException
4. InstantiationException
5. InterruptedException
6. NoSuchFieldException
7. NoSuchMethodException
8. SQLException

UNCHECKED/RUNTIME EXCEPTIONS
			considered fatal
			not detected at the time of compilation
			encountered only when the program is in execution
			called unchecked because the compiler does not check to see if a method handles or throws these exceptions.

1. ArithmeticException
2. NullPointerException
3. ArrayStoreexception
4. ClassCastException
5. IndexoutOfBoundsException
6. ArrayIndexoutOfBoundsException
7. StringIndexoutOfBoundsException
8. NegativeArraySizeException
9. NumberFormatException
10. IllegalArgumentException
11. IllegalStateException
12. IllegalThreadStateException   


***finally block WITHOUT A TRY BLOCK gives a compile time error
